## Procedure for editing
*This is for those on the dev team*
* Notify everyone on the Team Lucy Discord channel that you are editing.
* Do a git pull
* Make your changes
* Commit your changes to GitHub and push.
* Notify everyone on the Team Lucy Discord channel that you've finished changes

### If you need more time to implement your changes
If you need to spend more than 6 hours implementing your changes, you should create a branch.

Commit a git branch, then notify Weilon on the Team Lucy Discord channel that you are making a branch. In your message, note down what parts of the game you are editing, in as much detail as possible. Continue making your changes in your own branch. Ensure you're not on master when you commit your changes.

Once you've finished making your changes, submit a pull request to the master branch, and Weilon will review your changes. If there are no problems, your changes will be merged to master. 

After your changes have been merged., you can continue making changes on the master branch again.
